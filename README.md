# Getting Started

This is a sample project to demonstrate how to use Spring Boot with Spring Oauth2 Authorization Server.

## Prerequisites

* Java 17
* Docker
* Docker Compose
* Gradle
* OpenSSL

## Build

```shell
./gradlew build
```

## Run

Execute the docker-compose file to start the database.

```shell
scripts/docker-compose up
```

Start the application with the following command:
```shell
./gradlew bootRun
```


## Environment Variables
Required env variables for the application to run.

```shell
DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5433/oauth_nowhere
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=nowhere
```

## Private Key Files

Create your own private key files and place them in the root directory of the project. This is for testing purposes, in production you should use a secure key store like ansible vault.

Create private key
```shell
openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 2048
```
Create public key
```shell
openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
```
Create pkcs8 format
```shell
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -nocrypt -in private.pem -out private-pkcs8.pem
```

Place the private--pkcs8.pem and the public.pem in the resources folder.
